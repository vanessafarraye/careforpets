# careforpets

Care For Pets is a web-app created by Vanessa Farraye, student at General Asssembly's Web Development Immersive Program in San Francisco. The reason I was motivated to create this app was to help animals in need of medical assistance.

It's amazing the power of what we can accomplish if we all work together and why not rally around helping a living being in need.
